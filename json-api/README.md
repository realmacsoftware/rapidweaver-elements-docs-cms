# JSON REST API

The Elements CMS Online Editor includes a token-authenticated JSON REST API for headless use. Your apps, mobile clients, static builds, and migration scripts can read and write CMS content over HTTPS with a simple `Authorization: Bearer api_...` header.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Studio / JSON API access is required.** Every `/api/*` route, including public reads, requires an active license for the site's domain with JSON API access enabled. Without one, every request returns `402 Payment Required`.
{% endhint %}
