# Authentication and API Keys

Every authenticated route on the JSON REST API uses a Bearer key prefixed with `api_`.

{% hint style="info" %}
`api_` keys and `mcp_` tokens are separate. `api_...` keys authenticate the JSON REST API documented here. `mcp_...` tokens authenticate the Model Context Protocol endpoint used by AI agents. The two key families do not work interchangeably.
{% endhint %}

### How keys work

* Keys are created by an owner on the **API** page inside the Online Editor.
* The API page is available only when the site has a license with JSON API access.
* Each key is bound to a specific user account.
* Requests made with the key act as that user and inherit their role.
* The plaintext key is shown once at creation. The server stores only a hash.
* Revoking a key takes effect on the next request.

### Send the key

Preferred header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer api_exampletoken000000000000
```

Fallback query string, for clients that cannot set custom headers:

```text
https://example.test/api/cms/collections/blog/items?token=api_exampletoken000000000000
```

The header is preferred because query strings can appear in browser history, server logs, analytics, and shared screenshots.

### Test a key

```sh
curl -i \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer api_exampletoken000000000000" \
  https://example.test/api/cms/
```

Expected: `200 OK` with a JSON body describing the API.

### Wrong key family

Using an `mcp_...` token against the JSON API returns `401 Unauthorized` with a message explaining that MCP tokens belong to the MCP endpoint, not the JSON REST API.

### Status codes

| Code | Meaning | Typical fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | OK | No action needed. |
| `401` | No key, invalid key, or wrong key family. | Generate an `api_...` key on the Online Editor's API page. |
| `402` | No active license with JSON API access. | Activate a license with JSON API access, or see [Upgrading and Downgrading Plans](../upgrading-and-downgrading-plans.md). |
| `403` | The key is valid, but the bound user lacks the role for this action. | Use a key bound to a user with the required role. |
| `404` | Collection, item, or resource does not exist. | Check the URL and collection slug. |
| `409` | Resource rename or move conflict. | Choose a different target name or destination. |

See [Errors](errors.md) for the full response envelope and troubleshooting checklist.

### Rotate or revoke keys

To rotate a key, create a new one, deploy it to clients, then revoke the old one. To revoke a key, open the Online Editor's **API** page and delete it from the key list.
